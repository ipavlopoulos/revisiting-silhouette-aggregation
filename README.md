# Revisiting Silhouette: From Micro to Macro Aggregation 

Silhouette coefficient is an established internal clustering evaluation measure that produces a score per data point, assessing the quality of its clustering assignment. To assess the quality of the clustering of the whole dataset, the scores of all the points in the dataset are typically (micro) averaged into a single value. An alternative path, however, that is rarely employed, is to average first at the cluster level and then (macro) average across clusters. As we illustrate in this work with a synthetic example, the typical micro-averaging strategy is sensitive to cluster imbalance while the overlooked macro-averaging strategy is far more robust. By investigating macro-Silhouette further, we find that uniform sub-sampling, the only available strategy in existing libraries, harms the measureâ€™s robustness against imbalance. We address this issue by proposing a per-cluster sampling method. An experimental study on eight real-world datasets is then used to analyse both coefficients in two clustering tasks.
